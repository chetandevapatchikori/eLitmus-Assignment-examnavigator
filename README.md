+ The chrome extension was named as Exam Navigator which helps in preventing cheating during exams.
+ To make the extention to work on particular urls  i have used  matches and stored required urls in manifesto.js
In the background.js it should observe whether a person is switching the tab while writing the exam and show alert message  as “You switched to tab – “. 
Later we need to check if more than one tab is open i.e., if  (tabId > 1) it should show popup message which shows alert message as “You have more than one tab open!”
restricted from opening new tab
